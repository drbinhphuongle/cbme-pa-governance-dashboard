**Implications:**  

## Keywords
CBME; programmatic assessment; governance; clinical competency committee; entrustment; dashboard; fairness

## 1. Introduction
- PA/CBME often struggles operationally: volume, inconsistency, underused narrative, limited auditability.
- Gap: few packaged solutions that combine governance + decision rules + minimal-data dashboard to support defensible CCC decisions.

## 2. Design Principles
1) Decision-oriented  
2) Triangulation & sufficiency  
3) Recency matters  
4) Fairness & consistency  
5) Auditability  
6) Minimal viable data  
7) Feedback-to-action loop  

## 3. Governance Model
### 3.1 Roles (RACI summary)
Program Director, CCC Chair/Members, Coaches/Mentors, Assessors, Data Steward.

### 3.2 Workflow
Collection → synthesis → CCC decision → action plan → follow-up.

### 3.3 Cadence
Weekly huddles / monthly CCC / quarterly QI review.

### 3.4 Due process & appeals
Transparency, documentation, appeal path, defensibility.

## 4. Decision Rules & Evidence Standards
- Minimum evidence standard (min observations, diversity, recency, narrative requirement)
- Standardized CCC outcomes (Green/Amber/Red/Data action)
- Outlier handling (assessor leniency/stringency signal → calibration)

## 5. Dashboard Architecture (Minimal-Data)
- Data model: Observation table + Learner master + EPA master
- 3 views: Learner Snapshot / EPA Progress / Quality & Fairness
- Audit log (minimal viable) linked to CCC minutes

## 6. Quality, Fairness, and Measurement
Define and justify 12 KPIs (narrative rate, actionable narrative, missingness, recency compliance, assessor variance, coverage, red flags, time-to-decision, follow-up completion, etc.)

## 7. Implementation Guide (60–90 days)
Pilot-first in one rotation/site; training + calibration; minimal change management.

## 8. Discussion
Novelty, strengths, limitations (no LMS/EHR integration), generalizability, future research agenda.

## 9. Conclusion
Governance + dashboard makes PA “decision-capable” with minimal data.

## Declarations
