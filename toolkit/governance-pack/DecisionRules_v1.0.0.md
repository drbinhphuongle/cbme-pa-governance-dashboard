# CBME Programmatic Assessment — Decision Rules & Evidence Standards (v1.0.0)

## A. Minimum Evidence Standard (per EPA)
An EPA is considered **decision-ready** only when ALL conditions are met:
1) **Minimum observations:** ≥ 4 observations/ratings for the EPA  
2) **Minimum assessors:** ≥ 2 different assessors  
3) **Role diversity:** ≥ 2 assessor roles (e.g., faculty + senior resident / supervisor + peer)  
4) **Recency:** ≥ 2 observations within the last **8 weeks** (or within the current rotation)  
5) **Context diversity:** ≥ 2 different settings and/or case types  
6) **Narrative requirement:** ≥ 2 narrative comments, with ≥ 1 describing **observable behavior + improvement action**  
7) **Flags:** any patient safety/professionalism flag triggers CCC review (no automatic “pass”)

**If not met → default outcome: _Not enough evidence (Data action)_.**

## B. Standardized CCC outcomes (4 outcomes)
1) **Progress as expected (Green)**  
2) **Targeted support (Amber)** — coaching plan for 4–6 weeks  
3) **Focused remediation (Red)** — remediation plan for 8–12 weeks + reassessment schedule  
4) **Not enough evidence (Data action)** — request targeted additional assessment

## C. Trigger thresholds (minimal, adjustable)
### Green (Progress as expected)
- Minimum evidence met, AND
- EPA performance (median/mean) is **at or above expected level** for the stage, AND
- No significant flags; narratives do not indicate critical gaps in safety/professionalism.

### Amber (Targeted support)
Triggered by ANY of the following (with minimum evidence met):
- Performance is **0.5–1 level below expected**, or trend is flat/declining.
- Recurrent narrative themes indicate a gap suitable for coaching (e.g., reasoning, communication, organization).
- High inter-assessor variability (e.g., SD high) without clear safety concern.

**Action:** assign owner coach, define goals, require 2–3 focused observations, review in 4–6 weeks.

### Red (Focused remediation)
Triggered by ANY of the following:
- Credible or recurrent **patient safety/professionalism flags**, OR
- Performance is **≥ 1 level below expected** with consistent narratives indicating core competence deficit, OR
- Failure to improve after two Amber cycles, OR
- Multiple EPAs show sustained underperformance (“at-risk” profile).

**Action:** remediation plan (8–12 weeks), reassessment criteria, documentation, and due process.

### Not enough evidence (Data action)
Triggered when the Minimum Evidence Standard is not met:
- Missingness, low recency, insufficient diversity, or insufficient narrative.
**Action:** create a targeted assessment plan (who/what/when/where) to close evidence gaps.

## D. Outlier handling (assessor leniency/stringency signal)
- Calculate a simple **assessor z-score** (relative to program/rotation mean) for entrustment ratings.
- If an assessor is consistently extreme (lenient or stringent), **flag for calibration**.
- Do **not** delete data; use the signal to interpret patterns and improve rater consistency.

## E. Documentation requirements (auditability)
For each CCC decision, record:
- Evidence sufficiency met? (Yes/No)  
- Rules applied (Green/Amber/Red/Data action)  
- Rationale (evidence summary + narrative themes + flags)  
- Action plan, owner, and follow-up date  
- Learner notification and (if applicable) appeal status
